# BikesRegression
One regression exercise working with bikes data.

## Steps done (data set is pretty clean)

1. Go over all possible combinatioons of features and a collection of algorithms to choose the better fitted for the task.
2. Conclusion is that we choose all features and Random Forest.
3. Some graphs that show this.
4. Just for practice, use a pieline to confirm my discoveries and add NN to the analysis (no Keras yet). 
5. Going over hyperparameters tuning (not done as per 11/30/23)
